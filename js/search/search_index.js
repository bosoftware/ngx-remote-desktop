It has been tested in Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari. It makes heavy use of flex, therefore it will not work in browsers that do not support flex. \nThere is no dependency on any presentation component library / framework (ng-bootstrap, clarity etc.). This component does not make any assertions about how the backend web socket broker to guacd is implemented.\nBy default, there are no toolbar items, however, you can add as many toolbar items as you wish and create a handler in your component. You can also override the scss if you wish to change the styling. The RemoteDesktopManager exposes some useful methods for generating a screenshot or thumbnail, entering and exiting full screen mode, focusing and unfocusing the display, getting the client state, subscribing to the remote desktop clipboard and sending data to the remote desktop clipboard.\n\nFeatures\n\nFluid screen resizing and scaling\nFull screen mode\nToolbar (auto hide when in full screen mode)\nTake a screenshot\nGet a thumbnail\nSubscribe to the remote clipboard observable and receive remote clipboard data\nSend data to the remote clipboard\nStatus bar (optional) to provide contextual information\n\nFor a full implementation example, see the demo source code\nInstallation\nTo use ngx-remote-desktop in your project, install it via npm:\nnpm i @illgrenoble/ngx-remote-desktop --saveWe also require two peer dependencies:\nnpm i @illgrenoble/guacamole-common-js --save\nnpm i screenfull --saveThank you\nThank you to the guacamole team for a fantastic project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview -
